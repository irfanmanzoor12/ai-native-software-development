# Chapter 13: Introduction to Python

## Overview

Welcome to Python—the language of AI-driven development. This chapter introduces Python as a powerful, readable language that serves as the foundation for AI systems worldwide. You'll learn what Python is, get it running on your computer, and write your first programs using the `print()` function.

This chapter provides the foundation you need before diving into variables and data types in Chapter 14. By the end, you'll understand Python's role in AI development, have a working Python installation, and know how to create and run basic Python programs.

This chapter applies the AI-Native Learning methodology: you explore concepts with your AI companion (Claude Code or Gemini CLI), validate your understanding through hands-on practice, and learn from errors by asking "why?" This pattern continues throughout Part 4.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Explain what Python is** and why it's the ideal language for AI development (Lesson 1)
2. **Install Python 3.14+** on your computer and verify everything works (Lesson 2)
3. **Create and run Python program files** using the `print()` function (Lesson 3)

**What's next**: Chapter 14 teaches you to store data in **variables with type hints**—the foundation for all Python programming.

## Estimated Time

Total estimated time for this chapter: **2.5-3 hours**

- **Lesson 1 (What Is Python)**: 40 minutes
- **Lesson 2 (Installing Python)**: 90 minutes
- **Lesson 3 (Hello World and Print)**: 40 minutes

## Prerequisites

You should have already completed Chapters 1-12 of this book, especially:
- **Chapters 1-4**: Understanding the AI-Driven Development mindset
- **Chapters 5-6**: Proficiency with your AI tool (Claude Code or Gemini CLI)
- **Chapter 7**: Basic terminal/command-line skills
- **Chapters 10-11**: Prompt and context engineering

No prior programming experience required—we start from zero.

## Tools You'll Need

- **Python 3.14+** (we install this in Lesson 2)
- **Text editor or IDE** (VS Code, Cursor, or similar)
- **Terminal/command line** (Windows PowerShell, Mac Terminal, or Linux Terminal)
- **Your AI tool** (Claude Code or Gemini CLI for exploring and validating)

## Key Themes Throughout This Chapter

### Theme 1: Foundation First

This chapter focuses on the essentials: understanding what Python is, installing it, and running basic programs. Variables, type hints, and complex programs come in Chapter 14. Take time to build a solid foundation.

### Theme 2: AI as Learning Partner

Throughout every lesson, you'll collaborate with your AI companion:
- To explore concepts and ask "why?"
- To validate your understanding
- To troubleshoot errors
- To practice explaining concepts in your own words

This is professional development practice, and it's how you'll work for the rest of this book.

### Theme 3: Hands-On Practice

Don't just read the code examples—type them yourself, run them, modify them, break them, and fix them. Hands-on experience is how you truly learn programming.

## Lesson Structure

Each lesson follows the same pattern:

1. **Core Content**: Clear explanations with real-world examples
2. **Code Examples**: Tested, commented, beginner-friendly
3. **Common Mistakes**: Proactive guidance on pitfalls
4. **CoLearning Elements** (💬🎓🚀✨): Prompts and activities with AI
5. **"Try With AI"**: 4 progressive prompts (Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze)

**Important**: Every lesson ends with "Try With AI"—no additional summary or checklist. That section is your cognitive closure for the lesson.

## How to Use This Chapter

**Read in order**: Lessons 1-3 build on each other. Don't skip ahead.

**Do every "Try With AI" prompt**: These aren't optional extras—they're where the real learning happens. Take time with each prompt, think through your answers, and engage authentically with your AI partner.

**Test all code examples**: Run every code example yourself. Don't just read it. See it work (or fail) on your computer. That hands-on experience matters.

**Move to Chapter 14 when ready**: Once you complete Chapter 13, move immediately to Chapter 14 (Data Types) where you'll learn variables, type hints, and how to store data.

## Connection to Your Learning Journey

### From Part 3 → Part 4

In Part 3, you learned AI-Driven Development principles and how to work with AI tools. In Part 4, you're learning Python—the primary language for AI development. This chapter is the bridge: it applies AIDD principles *to* learning Python.

### From Chapter 13 → Chapter 14+

**Chapter 13** provides the foundation: What is Python, installing Python, and basic `print()` programs.

**Chapter 14** builds on this: Variables with type hints, data types (int, float, str, bool), and type exploration. This is where Python gets powerful.

**Chapter 15+** covers operators, strings, control flow, functions, and beyond. Everything builds on Chapters 13-14.

### Preparing for Part 5

Part 5 introduces Specification-Driven Development (SDD)—the professional practice of writing detailed specifications before coding. Chapter 14 previews this with **type hints as intent description**. By the time you reach Part 5, specification-first thinking will feel natural.

## A Note on AI Collaboration

This chapter assumes you have access to Claude Code or Gemini CLI (or a similar AI tool). Every "Try With AI" section references your AI companion. If you don't have access yet, revisit Chapters 5-6 to set up your tool before proceeding.

Your AI tool isn't a crutch—it's a partner in learning. Use it to:
- Clarify concepts
- Validate your code
- Understand error messages
- Review your work
- Reflect on your learning

Professional developers use AI daily. Learning to use it effectively is a core skill this chapter teaches.
